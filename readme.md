# Lambda Calculus Type Inference

Type inference is the process of finding a type for a λ -term. This repository contains the project for implementing a simple and transparent version of type inference for the λ -calculus.

## Getting Started

In the file `Coursework.hs`, you will find the initial implementation of the λ -calculus from the tutorials. The project is divided into several assignments, each contributing to the development of the type inference system. These assignments are designed to be independent in some cases, or build on each other, so if you encounter challenges, feel free to attempt the next assignment.
